== Setting Up the Battlefield
Before you can start fighting for control, you need to prepare the game board:

. Set the {icon-target} *Target* die to 2.
. Place the {icon-marker} *Operation Marker* on the first space of the Operation Track.-. Add 2 {icon-tank} *Tanks* to each Player's Supply.
. Give each player 4 {icon-squad} *Squads* and 3 {icon-resource} *Resources*.
. Starting with the *second* player, each player chooses a side, then places all of their {icon-squad} *Squads* on that side's spawn points.
. Deal 4 Action Cards to each player. Each player keeps one and hands the rest to the other. Repeat until each player has 2 Action Cards on their hand. The rest of the cards go back into the Action Deck and it is shuffled.
. The *first* player can now take their turn!


== Units
Each Unit is represented by a six-sided die. The value shown on top of them represents their current strength.


Unit Types::
    {icon-squad} Squad:::
        The most basic of Units, a squad of armed soldiers.
        
        Stats::::
        - Strength: 1 to 6
        - Range: 2
        
    {icon-tank} Tank:::
        Equipped with highly advanced tech, the Tank is a strong combat unit.
        
        Stats::::
        - Strength: 2 to 6
        - Range: 3
        
        Machinery::::
            If at any moment this Unit's strength reaches 2, it is destroyed. +
            Permanently remove it from the game and replace it with a {icon-squad} Squad with 1 strength. +
            Any remaining losses are discarded.
            
        Fullmetal::::
            At the start of an _Attack_, the defender suffers 1 loss. +
            If this results in their defeat, skip the _counter-attack_ phase.
        
        Motorized::::
            No more than once, after moving during a _March_, it may do 1 free movement.


== Player Turns 
During their turn, a player can take up to 2 actions. The same action may be taken more than once.

Actions::
    March:::
        Take up to 3 movements with any of your Units.
        
    Attack:::
        Choose a *Unit* to attack with (the "attacker") and an enemy target *Unit* that's within range (the "defender"). +
        The player that's attacking does as follows, in order:
        . The defender takes losses equal to the attackers strength + 1, minus their strength. __(On a tie, the defender takes 1 loss.)__
        . The defender does a _counter-attack_.
        . Once an involved *Unit*'s strength reaches 0, they are defeated.
        . If the attacker was defeated, move the Unit to any spawn point outside the Target Zone, they regain 2 strength.
        . If the defender was defeated:
            .. Move the defender to any spawn point outside the Target Zone, they regain 2 strength.
            .. Choose one of the following:
                ... Eliminate: Gain 3 VP.
                ... Capture: Gain 1 VP and 2 {icon-resource} *Resources*.
        . Otherwise, if the defender is in a Village, Tower or Ballista, move it to any adjacent space.

    Bolster:::
        If you have no more Units in play, place up to 2 Squads from your Supply on the 2 Villages furthest away from the Target Zone.
  
WARNING: If your Supply is empty, you cannot _Bolster_, and *immediately* lose the game.

NOTE: Adjacent spaces are orthogonal: Up, down, left and right. +
      Diagonal spaces are non-adjacent.

Action Cards::
    At the start of their turn, a player may play a single *Action Card* from their hand, this does not count as an action. +
    The player can also ignore the card's effect to gain 1 {icon-resource} *Resource* until the end of their turn. +
    Once it's been played, the card goes back to the *Action Card* deck, and it is shuffled. +

    Desperate Measures:::
        One of your Units suffers 2 losses. +
        Gain 2 {icon-resource} *Resources*.

    Forward!:::
        Do a _March_ action, but you cannot move the same Unit more than once. +
        __({icon-tank} *Tanks* do not get any free movement).__

    Sabotage:::
        Pay up to 2 {icon-resource} *Resources*. +
        Move a single enemy Unit once per {icon-resource} *Resource* spent.

    Exhaustion:::
        During the opponent's next turn, they take -1 movement on their _March_ action.

    Fuel Shortage:::
        Pay 1 {icon-resource} *Resource*. +
        During their next turn, the opponent cannot move any {icon-tank} *Tanks* with their _March_ action.

    Bullseye:::
        On your next _Attack_ action during this turn, the defender takes +1 loss.

    Supply and Demand:::
        During your opponent's next turn, _Upgrading_ costs +1 {icon-resource} *Resource*.

    Faster Tech:::
        The {icon-marker} *Operation Marker* advances one space.
        
    Navigation Expert:::
        Pay 1 {icon-resource} *Resource*. +
        During your next _March_ action this turn, ignore extra movement costs.
    
    Scare Tactics:::
        Pay 1 {icon-resource} *Resource*. +
        During the opponent's next turn, calculate losses as if your attacked Units have +1 strength. +
        _(A Unit can have no more than 6 strength.)_

            The strength of the {icon-tank} *Tank* is equal to the old {icon-squad} *Squad*'s strength + 2. +
            The old {icon-squad} *Squad* goes into the player's supply if possible. +
